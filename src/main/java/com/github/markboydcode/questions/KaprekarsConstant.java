 * Calculates for any four digit number the number of iterations it takes to arrive at Kaprekar's constant of 6174 by

 *
 * 1) Take any four digit number (whose digits are not all identical).
 * 2) Rearrange the string of digits to form the largest and smallest 4-digit numbers possible.
 * 3) Take these two numbers and subtract the smaller number from the larger.
 * 4) Use the number you obtain and repeat the above process until you arrive at Kaprekar's constant of 6174.
 * 5) Return the count of the number of iterations it took to arrive at the constant.
